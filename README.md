P06 Alphabet Train

Overview

This assignment is inspired by Bob the Train‚Äôs Alphabet Adventure. It involves the implementation of a chain of alphabet linked carts as a doubly-linked list from scratch. Figure 1 presents a graphic illustration of the objects that we are going to use in this program (a cart, a linked cart, and an alphabet list). Each node in our doubly-linked list will be an object of the LinkedCart class. As shown in Figure 1(a), each LinkedCart contains a link to the previous node, a link o the next node in the list, and a data field called cart. Figures 1(c) and (d) illustrate samples of our alphabet doubly-linked list. Note that the cargo carried by a cart in our alphabet list must be one upper-case alphabet letter. Note also that our list is sorted and does not contain duplicate letters.

(a) One linked cart (b) A set of linked carts

(c) Alphabet List (sample#1) (d) Alphabet List (sample#2)

Learning Objectives

The goals of this assignment include:

‚Ä¢ Implement a doubly linked list of alphabet carts from scratch.

‚Ä¢ Further developing your experience working with object oriented design code and exception handling.

‚Ä¢ Gain more experience with developing unit tests.

Grading Rubric

15 points Immediate Automated Tests: Upon submission of your assignment to Gradescope, you will receive feedback from automated grading tests about whether specific parts of your submission conform to this write-up specification. If these tests detect problems in your code, they will attempt to give you some feedback about the kind of defect that they noticed. Note that passing all of these tests does NOT mean your program is otherwise correct. To become more confident in this, you should run additional tests of your own.

30 points Manual Grading and Supplemental Automated Tests: When your final grade feedback appears on Gradescope, it will include the feedback from these additional automated grading tests, as well as feedback from human graders who review the code in your submission by hand.

Assignment Requirements and Reminders

‚Ä¢ DO NOT submit the provided SortedListADT.java and Cart.java source files on Gradescope.

‚Ä¢ You HAVE TO submit ONLY the three source files that you created on Gradescope.

‚Ä¢ You ARE NOT allowed to use a dummy node at the head of the AlphabetList doubly-linked list.

‚Ä¢ You ARE NOT allowed to add any fields either instance or static, and any public methods either static or instance to your LinkedCart, and AlphabetList classes, other than those defined in this write-up and these javadocs.

‚Ä¢ You CAN define private methods to help implement the different public methods defined in these javadocs, if needed.

‚Ä¢ ALL your test methods MUST be implemented in your AlphabetListTester class.

‚Ä¢ In addition to the required test methods, we HIGHLY recommend (not require) that you develop your additional own unit tests (public static methods that return a boolean).

‚Ä¢ Ensure that your code for every assignment is styled in conformance to CS300 Course Style Guide.

‚Ä¢ Feel free to reuse the javadoc method headers provided in these javadocs in your class and method javadoc headers.

1 Getting Started

2 Create the LinkedCart class

Create a new class called LinkedCart. Each instance of this class represents a linked cart (as graphically illustrated in 1.(a) and (b). Every LinkedCart object should have ONLY the THREE following instance fields.

private final Cart CART; // data field of this linked Cart private LinkedCart previous; // reference to the previous linked cart in

// a list of carts

private LinkedCart next; // reference to the next linked cart in a list of carts

Now, implement the constructors and the public methods defined for the LinkedCart class according to their detailed javadocs description provided within these javadocs. At meantime, implement the test method testLinkedCart() in your AlphabetListTester class with accordance to the details provided in its javadoc style method header.

3 Create the AlphabetList class

Now, create a new class called AlphabetList and add it to your P06 project source folder. This class MUST implement the provided interface SortedListADT&lt; Cart &gt;. This class models the doubly-linked list data structure which stores elements of type Cart in ascending sorted order. This class MUST define the following instance and static fields ONLY.

private static final Cart MIN_CART = new Cart(‚ÄúA‚Äù); // The smallest cart that

// can be added to this sorted list

private static final Cart MAX_CART = new Cart(‚ÄúZ‚Äù); // The largest cart that

// can be added to this sorted list

private LinkedCart head; // head of this doubly linked list private LinkedCart tail; // tail of this doubly linked list private int size; // size of this list

private int capacity; // maximum number of carts which can be stored in this list

You are not allowed to add any additional instance or static field to this class. Recall also that you ARE NOT allowed to use a dummy node at the head of the AlphabetList.

Provided implementation of AlphabetList.toString() method:

String string = ‚ÄúThis list contains ‚Äù + size + ‚Äù cart(s)‚Äù; if (size == 0) { return string;

}

string += ‚Äú: [ ‚Äú;

LinkedCart currentCart = head; while (currentCart != null) {

string += currentCart.getCart().toString() + ‚Äù ‚Äú; currentCart = currentCart.getNext();

} string += ‚Äú]‚Äù; return string;

Make sure to design and implement all the test methods defined in these javadocs. If a test method contains multiple test scenarios, we recommend that you break it down into smaller private test methods. You are also HIGHLY encouraged to add additional test methods to your AlphabetListTester class to gain confidence that are the methods defined in your AlphabetList are working correctly with respect to these javadocs. Recall that all your test methods MUST be static, do not take any input parameter, and return a boolean (true if the expected behavior is satisfied and false otherwise).

Here are some tips for the implementation of your test methods. First, you have to read the method‚Äôs javadoc style header and determine how each method is supposed to operate with different input parameters. For instance, you can ask yourself the following questions:

1. Is a newly created train empty? (it should be empty)

2. Is a train with a single cart empty? (it should not be empty)

3. If you add a cart with ‚ÄúZ‚Äù and then a cart with ‚ÄúA‚Äù, does your train place the ‚ÄúA‚Äù cart before the ‚ÄúZ‚Äù cart? (it should place the ‚ÄúA‚Äù cart first)

4. If you add two carts with ‚ÄúA‚Äù, does it throw an exception? (it should throw an exception with the right description)

Illustrative Example

In order to provide you with a better understanding on how to use the implemented classes, we provide in the following an example of source code and its expected output, when the methods are called with correct input arguments.

AlphabetList letters = new AlphabetList(); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúD‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúB‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúC‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúF‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúA‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúZ‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters); letters.add(new Cart(‚ÄúE‚Äù)); System.out.println(letters);

System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Forward: ‚Äù + letters.readForward()); System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Backward: ‚Äù + letters.readBackward()); letters.remove(0); System.out.println(letters); letters.remove(letters.size() -1); System.out.println(letters); letters.remove(3); System.out.println(letters);

System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Forward: ‚Äù + letters.readForward()); System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Backward: ‚Äù + letters.readBackward()); letters.clear(); System.out.println(letters);

System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Forward: ‚Äù + letters.readForward());

System.out.println(‚ÄúRead Backward: ‚Äù + letters.readBackward());

Expected output:

This list contains 0 cart(s)

This list contains 1 cart(s): [ D ]

This list contains 2 cart(s): [ B D ]

This list contains 3 cart(s): [ B C D ]

This list contains 4 cart(s): [ B C D F ]

This list contains 5 cart(s): [ A B C D F ]

This list contains 6 cart(s): [ A B C D F Z ]

This list contains 7 cart(s): [ A B C D E F Z ]

Read Forward: ABCDEFZ

Read Backward: ZFEDCBA

This list contains 6 cart(s): [ B C D E F Z ]

This list contains 5 cart(s): [ B C D E F ]

This list contains 4 cart(s): [ B C D F ]

Read Forward: BCDF

Read Backward: FDCB This list contains 0 cart(s) Read Forward:
